# minc_lexical-analyzer_syntaxChecker

## Description
Compiler Implementation
- Level 1 Lexical Analyzer
- Level 2 Syntax Analyzer.

Codded in Java, Compile C Minus Language 


## Libary Required
[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)  
[JFlex/ YACC](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/#flex)

## How to run
flex-1.6.1.jar was used for generating Lexer.java from Lexer.flex   
[This file is already generated, regenerating the file is not required]   
Generate with [JFlex/ YACC](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/#flex)   


### Instruction to run
1. command and move to the source directory
2. compile all java files
``` javac *.java ```

3. run with fail_01.minc as input   
 ``` java Program fail_01.minc > f1.txt ```
  

## What have I learned
- Compiler design and implementation; scanning,parsing, semantic analysis, optimization (including static analysis), code generation, garbage collection, and error detection.
- Context-Free Language 
- JFlex/ YACC
- Bison
